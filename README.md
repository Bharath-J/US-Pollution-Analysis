# US-Pollution-Analysis
In this code, I have downloaded ozone level data from US EPA webpage and read into the script. 
I have divided the United States into East and West based on the longitudinal values available in the data.
Then, I have calculated the mean and median of ozone levels of counties in Eastern and Western United States and tabulated the 
results
